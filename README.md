# Quiz App Project

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This Quiz App project followed the [React / Typescript Tutorial - Build a Quiz App YouTube video,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2JCjVSZlG0) as a way to learn and practice TypeScript with React.

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `yarn test`

Tests have been added using [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro).
